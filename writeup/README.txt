There were some failed grasps. I think we should label these as their own
category, "failure," so that the robot can also recognize when it missed an
object. The failures were:

#Times	Object			Grasp
1		tape			g
1		tape			w
2?		wood block		m
1		wicker ball		w
2		foam star		w
2		foam star		m
1		styrofoam		m
2		cookie cutter	g
2		cookie cutter	m
1		octopus			w

There were also some mislabels:
- The last "tape" should actually be a "bean bag."
- The last 7 or 8 "butterflies" should have been "styrofoam balls."
- The last "cookie cutter" is a "bottle."

Many objects were done in multiple orientations, not just one, so that may
spice things up a bit.

You should probably ignore/delete all the reindeer data sets. They're mostly
failures.
