The overall goal of this project is to implement the adaptive grasping algorithms of Humberston and Pai \cite{Ben} on the Barrett robotic arm and hand. There, stable grasps were sampled and then used to ``seed'' later grasps with a similar shape, to establish a more ``natural'' grasp. The goal in the original context was to achieve a more realistic appearance in the animation of precision hand manipulations. As opposed to this, our goal in achieving more natural grasps is slightly different: we wish to generate a more reliable and flexible grasp by mimicking human prehensile behavior. The implementation of the grasp adaptation will be based on the tactile read out in subsequent grasping tasks. We hope to thereby increase grasp stability and dexterity.
