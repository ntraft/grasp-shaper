\section{Future Work}
Our future work will take the discussed ideas into practice. Weekly goals are summarized in figure \ref{timeline}. We will spend approximately three weeks on implementing and testing our algorithm. Subsequently, we will test and optimize our algorithm depending on first results and applicability.

In general, two different subsequent directions for our research are possible:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Build context $c$ from some tactile feature vector.
\item Use tactile feature vector to determine "good" sample grasps and "bad" sample grasps.
\end{enumerate}
Further research ideas will depend on the quality of the tactile read out as well as the distinctiveness of these tactile feedback maps with respect to different shapes and grasps.
