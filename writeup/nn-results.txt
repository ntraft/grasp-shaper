Omitting Foam Objects

Heavy Regularization ($\lambda = 1000$)
Power Grip				Accuracy: 40.48\%
						All grasps were categorized as either 2, 4, 7, or 16
						(out of 14 objects total)
						4 only had 23% precision - but I don't remember seeing cookie cutter that often
						2 was also popular (again, don't remember seeing bottle that often, but sometimes)
Heavy Wrap				Accuracy: 39.49\%
						7, 13, 16 had near 100\% recall
						2, 4, 5 had smaller recall
						the remainder had 0\% recall
						(out of 11 objects total)
						13 had 35\% precision, 16 had only 27\% (tape? really? I don't ever remember seeing tape)
Prismatic Precision		Accuracy: 37.94\%
						All grasps categorized as 4, 7, or 14
						(out of 12 objects total)
						7 had 65% precision (which DOES align with what we saw in testing)
						4 had 27% precision (which DOES align with what we saw in testing)

Moderate Regularization ($\lambda = 100$)
Power Grip				Accuracy: 97.47\%
						recall of 11 was 88\%
						17 had 0\% recall
Heavy Wrap				Accuracy: 94.80\%
						17 had 33\% recall; all others good
Prismatic Precision		Accuracy: 96.38\%
						17 had 0\% recall

In tests:
	w gives wood block to everything
	m gives both cookie and sometimes wood block
	m gives cookie and white ball

Low Regularization ($\lambda \lt 10$)
All grips exhibit $\gt 99\%$ accuracy. Not sure if it's worth analyzing in more detail.
